Quick guide to github: <br />
Clicke on **Clone or Download**, copy the link <br />
**If you are using Mac**, on your machine, right click on the folder you wish to have your local repository and click **open Terminal (tab) at folder** (or something like that), once your terminal is opened, enter: **git clone (paste the link)**, hit enter. <br />
You should have a folder created within the destination folder, which has the stuffs currentlly in the git repo. You can work on that locally. <br />
If you wish to "upload" the stuffs you have worked on, right click on the folder of the git repo (the folder appreaed after you cloned the repo), click **open Terminal (tab) at folder**, and do the following steps:
* git add . **(There is a dot after add, don't forget about that)**
* git commit -m "some message" **(include a short note (i.e. updated model/added summary) of what changed, so if anything happens we could easily trace back to older versions)**
* git push

There are three steps. The first step selects files in the local directory, the "." will select all files under the directory. The second step commit the selected files to the local repository (so it is recorded locally, but others won't be able to see it online). The third step push the changes to the online repo, so others can see. <br />

If someone else made changes to the stuffs and pushed their changes, you can use **git pull** to pull the changes to your local machine, so that you can continue working on it. <br />

**If you are using Windows, I've never used Windows with git, I will add some info for windows later.**
